# Project Iminsi

Africa has a chronic media problem. It is very difficult to know what is happening in other countries in Africa without relying on western news coverage. Iminsi is the first all-African news app. The app uses the power of crowdsourcing to deliver a platform of reliable, local African news. 

## Architecture

Frontend can be found here: https://github.com/sanjanagoli/iminsi

## Setup

`cd iminsi-api` <br />
`yarn install` to install all dependencies <br />
`yarn start` to start server and database

## Deployment

Automatic deployments from master are enabled (any time a new change is pushed to master)

## Other Notes
What worked: We were able to successfully call the News API in our implementation. Our frontend developed a UI around display these news articles to users. We developed a system that allows users to login, indicate their preferences on articles, save articles to their profile, etc.
<br />
Future plans: In the future, we hope to call other external APIs that will allow us to aggregate news for more countries in Africa. We also hope to implement a automatic daily call to these external news APIs to fetch headlines on a daily basis.
